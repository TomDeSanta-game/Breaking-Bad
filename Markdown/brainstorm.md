# Episode 1 Development Plan - One Week Timeline

The first episode of our Breaking Bad game adaptation must establish Walter White's initial character arc from diagnosis to first cook. Pacing should mirror the show's balance of slow-burning character development punctuated by intense moments of decision and action. Key scenes to implement include: cancer diagnosis at the doctor's office, ride-along with Hank where Walt sees Jesse escape, first chemistry lesson to establish Walt's expertise, and the RV cook scene with Jesse. Each scene requires carefully designed interactive elements that give players agency while maintaining narrative fidelity. The episode should conclude with Walt's first successful batch, creating a satisfying gameplay loop that introduces the core cooking mechanics while establishing the dramatic stakes.

## Day-by-Day Development Breakdown
**Days 1-2:** Complete character controller refinements and implement doctor's office scene with diagnosis dialogue. Set up quest system triggers and initial character relationship states. **Days 3-4:** Build the ride-along scene with Hank, including tension system integration and first encounter with Jesse. Implement classroom chemistry mini-tutorial that foreshadows cooking mechanics. **Days 5-6:** Develop RV interior environment and implement simplified cooking mechanic focusing on timing and temperature control rather than complex chemistry. Add conflict scene with drug dealers. **Day 7:** Polish all transitions between scenes, implement save points, refine dialogue timing, and conduct playtesting to ensure the episode maintains proper pacing between narrative and interactive segments.

The technical implementation should prioritize core gameplay loops over visual polish while ensuring key Breaking Bad moments feel authentic. The meth cooking mechanic needs only baseline functionality with simplified steps (mix precursors, control temperature, cooling process) rather than the full chemistry crafting system planned for later episodes. Visual effects should focus on the cook sequence with minimal particle systems and post-processing to convey chemical reactions. Dialogue implementation through the Dialogic system should be prioritized with basic expressions and camera positioning. For quality assurance, maintain a checklist of iconic moments from Episode 1 and verify each is represented through gameplay rather than cutscenes where possible. This approach ensures we deliver a playable first episode that captures the essence of Breaking Bad's beginning while establishing foundational systems for future development.
